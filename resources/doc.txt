--- Day 2: I Was Told There Would Be No Math ---

The elves are running low on wrapping paper, and so they need to submit an order for more.
 They have a list of the dimensions (length l, width w, and height h) of each present, and only want to order exactly as much as they need.

Fortunately, every present is a box (a perfect right rectangular prism), which makes calculating the required wrapping paper for each gift a little easier: find the surface area of the box, which is 2*l*w + 2*w*h + 2*h*l. The elves also need a little extra paper for each present: the area of the smallest side.

For example:

    A present with dimensions 2x3x4 requires 2*6 + 2*12 + 2*8 = 52 square feet of wrapping paper plus 6 square feet of slack, for a total of 58 square feet.
    A present with dimensions 1x1x10 requires 2*1 + 2*10 + 2*10 = 42 square feet of wrapping paper plus 1 square foot of slack, for a total of 43 square feet.

All numbers in the elves' list are in feet. How many total square feet of wrapping paper should they order?


ll numbers in the elves' list are in feet. How many total square feet of wrapping paper should they order?

Your puzzle answer was 1588178.

- Part Two ---

The elves are also running low on ribbon. Ribbon is all the same width, so they only have to worry about the length they need to order, which they would again like to be exact.

The ribbon required to wrap a present is the shortest distance around its sides, or the smallest perimeter of any one face. Each present also requires a bow made out of ribbon as well; the feet of ribbon required for the perfect bow is equal to the cubic feet of volume of the present. Don't ask how they tie the bow, though; they'll never tell.

For example:

    A present with dimensions 2x3x4 requires 2+2+3+3 = 10 feet of ribbon to wrap the present plus 2*3*4 = 24 feet of ribbon for the bow, for a total of 34 feet.
    A present with dimensions 1x1x10 requires 1+1+1+1 = 4 feet of ribbon to wrap the present plus 1*1*10 = 10 feet of ribbon for the bow, for a total of 14 feet.

How many total feet of ribbon should they order?

 --- Day 3: Perfectly Spherical Houses in a Vacuum ---

Santa is delivering presents to an infinite two-dimensional grid of houses.

He begins by delivering a present to the house at his starting location, and then an elf at the North Pole calls him via radio and tells him where to move next. Moves are always exactly one house to the north (^), south (v), east (>), or west (<). After each move, he delivers another present to the house at his new location.

However, the elf back at the north pole has had a little too much eggnog, and so his directions are a little off, and Santa ends up visiting some houses more than once.
 ********************How many houses receive at least one present? ************************

For example:

    > delivers presents to 2 houses: one at the starting location, and one to the east.
    ^>v< delivers presents to 4 houses in a square, including twice to the house at his starting/ending location.
    ^v^v^v^v^v delivers a bunch of presents to some very lucky children at only 2 houses.


	 resultat 2565
	 
--- Part Two ---

The next year, to speed up the process, Santa creates a robot version of himself, Robo-Santa, to deliver presents with him.

Santa and Robo-Santa start at the same location (delivering two presents to the same starting house), then take turns moving based on instructions from the elf, who is eggnoggedly reading from the same script as the previous year.

This year, how many houses receive at least one present?

For example:

    ^v delivers presents to 3 houses, because Santa goes north, and then Robo-Santa goes south.
    ^>v< now delivers presents to 3 houses, and Santa and Robo-Santa end up back where they started.
    ^v^v^v^v^v now delivers presents to 11 houses, with Santa going one direction and Robo-Santa going the other.

--- Day 4: The Ideal Stocking Stuffer ---

Santa needs help mining some AdventCoins (very similar to bitcoins) to use as gifts for all the economically forward-thinking little girls and boys.

To do this, he needs to find MD5 hashes which, in hexadecimal, start with at least five zeroes. The input to the MD5 hash is some secret key (your puzzle input, given below) followed by a number in decimal. To mine AdventCoins, you must find Santa the lowest positive number (no leading zeroes: 1, 2, 3, ...) that produces such a hash.

For example:

    If your secret key is abcdef, the answer is 609043, because the MD5 hash of abcdef609043 starts with five zeroes (000001dbbfa...), and it is the lowest such number to do so.
    If your secret key is pqrstuv, the lowest number it combines with to make an MD5 hash starting with five zeroes is 1048970; that is, the MD5 hash of pqrstuv1048970 looks like 000006136ef....

--- Day 5: Doesn't He Have Intern-Elves For This? ---

Santa needs help figuring out which strings in his text file are naughty or nice.

A nice string is one with all of the following properties:

    It contains at least three vowels (aeiou only), like aei, xazegov, or aeiouaeiouaeiou.
    It contains at least one letter that appears twice in a row, like xx, abcdde (dd), or aabbccdd (aa, bb, cc, or dd).
    It does not contain the strings ab, cd, pq, or xy, even if they are part of one of the other requirements.

For example:

    ugknbfddgicrmopn is nice because it has at least three vowels (u...i...o...), a double letter (...dd...), and none of the disallowed substrings.
    aaa is nice because it has at least three vowels and a double letter, even though the letters used by different rules overlap.
    jchzalrnumimnmhp is naughty because it has no double letter.
    haegwjzuvuyypxyu is naughty because it contains the string xy.
    dvszwmarrgswjxmb is naughty because it contains only one vowel.

How many strings are nice?

--- Part Two ---

Realizing the error of his ways, Santa has switched to a better model of determining whether a string is naughty or nice. None of the old rules apply, as they are all clearly ridiculous.

Now, a nice string is one with all of the following properties:

    It contains a pair of any two letters that appears at least twice in the string without overlapping, like xyxy (xy) or aabcdefgaa (aa), but not like aaa (aa, but it overlaps).
    It contains at least one letter which repeats with exactly one letter between them, like xyx, abcdefeghi (efe), or even aaa.

For example:

    qjhvhtzxzqqjkmpb is nice because is has a pair that appears twice (qj) and a letter that repeats with exactly one letter between them (zxz).
    xxyxx is nice because it has a pair that appears twice and a letter that repeats with one between, even though the letters used by each rule overlap.
    uurcxstgmygtbstg is naughty because it has a pair (tg) but no repeat with a single letter between them.
    ieodomkazucvgmuy is naughty because it has a repeating letter with one between (odo), but no pair that appears twice.

How many strings are nice under these new rules?

--- Day 6: Probably a Fire Hazard ---
 your grid are numbered from 0 to 999 in each direction; the lights at each corner are at 0,0, 0,999, 999,999, and 999,0. The instructions include whether to turn on, turn off, or toggle various inclusive ranges given as coordinate pairs. Each coordinate pair represents opposite corners of a rectangle, inclusive; a coordinate pair like 0,0 through 2,2 therefore refers to 9 lights in a 3x3 square. The lights all start turned off.

To defeat your neighbors this year, all you have to do is set up your lights by doing the instructions Santa sent you in order.

For example:

    turn on 0,0 through 999,999 would turn on (or leave on) every light.
    toggle 0,0 through 999,0 would toggle the first line of 1000 lights, turning off the ones that were on, and turning on the ones that were off.
    turn off 499,499 through 500,500 would turn off (or leave off) the middle four lights.

After following the instructions, how many lights are lit?

Part Two ---

You just finish implementing your winning light pattern when you realize you mistranslated Santa's message from Ancient Nordic Elvish.

The light grid you bought actually has individual brightness controls; each light can have a brightness of zero or more. The lights all start at zero.

The phrase turn on actually means that you should increase the brightness of those lights by 1.

The phrase turn off actually means that you should decrease the brightness of those lights by 1, to a minimum of zero.

The phrase toggle actually means that you should increase the brightness of those lights by 2.

What is the total brightness of all lights combined after following Santa's instructions?

For example:

    turn on 0,0 through 0,0 would increase the total brightness by 1.
    toggle 0,0 through 999,999 would increase the total brightness by 2000000.

--- Day 7: Some Assembly Required ---

This year, Santa brought little Bobby Tables a set of wires and bitwise logic gates! Unfortunately, little Bobby is a little under the recommended age range, and he needs help assembling the circuit.

Each wire has an identifier (some lowercase letters) and can carry a 16-bit signal (a number from 0 to 65535). A signal is provided to each wire by a gate, another wire, or some specific value. Each wire can only get a signal from one source, but can provide its signal to multiple destinations. A gate provides no signal until all of its inputs have a signal.

The included instructions booklet describes how to connect the parts together: x AND y -> z means to connect wires x and y to an AND gate, and then connect its output to wire z.

For example:

    123 -> x means that the signal 123 is provided to wire x.
    x AND y -> z means that the bitwise AND of wire x and wire y is provided to wire z.
    p LSHIFT 2 -> q means that the value from wire p is left-shifted by 2 and then provided to wire q.
    NOT e -> f means that the bitwise complement of the value from wire e is provided to wire f.

Other possible gates include OR (bitwise OR) and RSHIFT (right-shift). If, for some reason, you'd like to emulate the circuit instead, almost all programming languages (for example, C, JavaScript, or Python) provide operators for these gates.

For example, here is a simple circuit:

123 -> x
456 -> y
x AND y -> d
x OR y -> e
x LSHIFT 2 -> f
y RSHIFT 2 -> g
NOT x -> h
NOT y -> i

After it is run, these are the signals on the wires:

d: 72
e: 507
f: 492
g: 114
h: 65412
i: 65079
x: 123
y: 456

In little Bobby's kit's instructions booklet (provided as your puzzle input), what signal is ultimately provided to wire a?

--- Day 8: Matchsticks ---

Space on the sleigh is limited this year, and so Santa will be bringing his list as a digital copy. He needs to know how much space it will take up when stored.

It is common in many programming languages to provide a way to escape special characters in strings. For example, C, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and even PHP handle special characters in very similar ways.

However, it is important to realize the difference between the number of characters in the code representation of the string literal and the number of characters in the in-memory string itself.

For example:

    "" is 2 characters of code (the two double quotes), but the string contains zero characters.
    "abc" is 5 characters of code, but 3 characters in the string data.
    "aaa\"aaa" is 10 characters of code, but the string itself contains six "a" characters and a single, escaped quote character, for a total of 7 characters in the string data.
    "\x27" is 6 characters of code, but the string itself contains just one - an apostrophe ('), escaped using hexadecimal notation.

Santa's list is a file that contains many double-quoted string literals, one on each line. The only escape sequences used are 
	\\ (which represents a single backslash), 
	\" (which represents a lone double-quote character), and 
	\x plus two hexadecimal characters (which represents a single character with that ASCII code).

Disregarding the whitespace in the file, what is the number of characters of code for string literals minus the number of characters in memory for the values of the strings in total for the entire file?

For example, given the four strings above, the total number of characters of string code (2 + 5 + 10 + 6 = 23) minus the total number of characters in memory for string values (0 + 3 + 7 + 1 = 11) is 23 - 11 = 12.

Now, let's go the other way. In addition to finding the number of characters of code, you should now encode each code representation as a new string and find the number of characters of the new encoded representation, including the surrounding double quotes.

For example:

    "" encodes to "\"\"", an increase from 2 characters to 6.
    "abc" encodes to "\"abc\"", an increase from 5 characters to 9.
    "aaa\"aaa" encodes to "\"aaa\\\"aaa\"", an increase from 10 characters to 16.
    "\x27" encodes to "\"\\x27\"", an increase from 6 characters to 11.

Your task is to find the total number of characters to represent the newly encoded strings minus the number of characters of code in each original string literal. For example, for the strings above, the total encoded length (6 + 9 + 16 + 11 = 42) minus the characters in the original code representation (23, just like in the first part of this puzzle) is 42 - 23 = 19.

- Day 9: All in a Single Night ---

Every year, Santa manages to deliver all of his presents in a single night.

This year, however, he has some new locations to visit; his elves have provided him the distances between every pair of locations. He can start and end at any two (different) locations he wants, but he must visit each location exactly once. What is the shortest distance he can travel to achieve this?

For example, given the following distances:

London to Dublin = 464
London to Belfast = 518
Dublin to Belfast = 141

The possible routes are therefore:

Dublin -> London -> Belfast = 982
London -> Dublin -> Belfast = 605
London -> Belfast -> Dublin = 659
Dublin -> Belfast -> London = 659
Belfast -> Dublin -> London = 605
Belfast -> London -> Dublin = 982

The shortest of these is London -> Dublin -> Belfast = 605, and so the answer is 605 in this example.

What is the distance of the shortest route?

--- Day 10: Elves Look, Elves Say ---

Today, the Elves are playing a game called look-and-say. They take turns making sequences by reading aloud the previous sequence and using that reading as the next sequence. For example, 211 is read as "one two, two ones", which becomes 1221 (1 2, 2 1s).

Look-and-say sequences are generated iteratively, using the previous value as input for the next step. For each step, take the previous value, and replace each run of digits (like 111) with the number of digits (3) followed by the digit itself (1).

For example:

1 becomes 11 (1 copy of digit 1).
11 becomes 21 (2 copies of digit 1).
21 becomes 1211 (one 2 followed by one 1).
1211 becomes 111221 (one 1, one 2, and two 1s).
111221 becomes 312211 (three 1s, two 2s, and one 1).

 Day 11: Corporate Policy ---

Santa's previous password expired, and he needs help choosing a new one.

To help him remember his new password after the old one expires, Santa has devised a method of coming
 up with a password based on the previous one. Corporate policy dictates that passwords must be exactly
 eight lowercase letters (for security reasons), so he finds his new password by incrementing his old
 password string repeatedly until it is valid.

Incrementing is just like counting with numbers: xx, xy, xz, ya, yb, and so on. Increase the rightmost
 letter one step; if it was z, it wraps around to a, and repeat with the next letter to the left until
 one doesn't wrap around.

Unfortunately for Santa, a new Security-Elf recently started, and he has imposed some additional
 password requirements:
1 :
Passwords must include one increasing straight of at least three letters, like abc, bcd, cde, and so
 on, up to xyz. They cannot skip letters; abd doesn't count.
2 :Passwords may not contain the letters i, o, or l, as these letters can be mistaken for other
 characters and are therefore confusing.
3 : Passwords must contain at least two different, non-overlapping pairs of letters, like aa, bb, or zz.

For example:

hijklmmn meets the first requirement (because it contains the straight hij) but fails the second
 requirement requirement (because it contains i and l).
abbceffg meets the third requirement (because it repeats bb and ff) but fails the first requirement.

abbcegjk fails the third requirement, because it only has one double letter (bb).
The next password after abcdefgh is abcdffaa.
The next password after ghijklmn is ghjaabcc, because you eventually skip all the passwords that start
 with ghi..., since i is not allowed.
Given Santa's current password (your puzzle input), what should his next password be?

Your puzzle input is vzbxkghb.

Santa's Accounting-Elves need help balancing the books after a recent order. Unfortunately, their accounting software uses a peculiar storage format. That's where you come in.

They have a JSON document which contains a variety of things: arrays ([1,2,3]), objects ({"a":1, "b":2}), numbers, and strings. Your first job is to simply find all of the numbers throughout the document and add them together.

For example:

[1,2,3] and {"a":2,"b":4} both have a sum of 6.
[[[3]]] and {"a":{"b":4},"c":-1} both have a sum of 3.
{"a":[-1,1]} and [-1,{"a":1}] both have a sum of 0.

--- Day 13: Knights of the Dinner Table ---

In years past, the holiday feast with your family hasn't gone so well. Not everyone gets along! This year, you resolve, will be different. You're going to find the optimal seating arrangement and avoid all those awkward conversations.

You start by writing up a list of everyone invited and the amount their happiness would increase or decrease if they were to find themselves sitting next to each other person. You have a circular table that will be just big enough to fit everyone comfortably, and so each person will have exactly two neighbors.

For example, suppose you have only four attendees planned, and you calculate their potential happiness as follows:

Alice would gain 54 happiness units by sitting next to Bob.
Alice would lose 79 happiness units by sitting next to Carol.
Alice would lose 2 happiness units by sitting next to David.
Bob would gain 83 happiness units by sitting next to Alice.
Bob would lose 7 happiness units by sitting next to Carol.
Bob would lose 63 happiness units by sitting next to David.
Carol would lose 62 happiness units by sitting next to Alice.
Carol would gain 60 happiness units by sitting next to Bob.
Carol would gain 55 happiness units by sitting next to David.
David would gain 46 happiness units by sitting next to Alice.
David would lose 7 happiness units by sitting next to Bob.
David would gain 41 happiness units by sitting next to Carol.
Then, if you seat Alice next to David, Alice would lose 2 happiness units (because David talks so much), but David would gain 46 happiness units (because Alice is such a good listener), for a total change of 44.

If you continue around the table, you could then seat Bob next to Alice (Bob gains 83, Alice gains 54). Finally, seat Carol, who sits next to Bob (Carol gains 60, Bob loses 7) and David (Carol gains 55, David gains 41). The arrangement looks like this:

     +41 +46
+55   David    -2
Carol       Alice
+60    Bob    +54
     -7  +83
After trying every other seating arrangement in this hypothetical scenario, you find that this one is the most optimal, with a total change in happiness of 330.

What is the total change in happiness for the optimal seating arrangement of the actual guest list?

To begin, get your puzzle input.

In all the commotion, you realize that you forgot to seat yourself. At this point, you're pretty apathetic toward the whole thing, and your happiness wouldn't really go up or down regardless of who you sit next to. You assume everyone else would be just as ambivalent about sitting next to you, too.

So, add yourself to the list, and give all happiness relationships that involve you a score of 0.

What is the total change in happiness for the optimal seating arrangement that actually includes yourself?

 Day 14: Reindeer Olympics ---

This year is the Reindeer Olympics! Reindeer can fly at high speeds, but must rest occasionally to recover their energy. Santa would like to know which of his reindeer is fastest, and so he has them race.

Reindeer can only either be flying (always at their top speed) or resting (not moving at all), and always spend whole seconds in either state.

For example, suppose you have the following Reindeer:

Comet can fly 14 km/s for 10 seconds, but then must rest for 127 seconds.
Dancer can fly 16 km/s for 11 seconds, but then must rest for 162 seconds.
After one second, Comet has gone 14 km, while Dancer has gone 16 km. After ten seconds, Comet has gone 140 km, while Dancer has gone 160 km. On the eleventh second, Comet begins resting (staying at 140 km), and Dancer continues on for a total distance of 176 km. On the 12th second, both reindeer are resting. They continue to rest until the 138th second, when Comet flies for another ten seconds. On the 174th second, Dancer flies for another 11 seconds.

In this example, after the 1000th second, both reindeer are resting, and Comet is in the lead at 1120 km (poor Dancer has only gotten 1056 km by that point). So, in this situation, Comet would win (if the race ended at 1000 seconds).

Given the descriptions of each reindeer (in your puzzle input), after exactly 2503 seconds, what distance has the winning reindeer traveled?

To begin, get your puzzle input.

Seeing how reindeer move in bursts, Santa decides he's not pleased with the old scoring system.

Instead, at the end of each second, he awards one point to the reindeer currently in the lead. (If there are multiple reindeer tied for the lead, they each get one point.) He keeps the traditional 2503 second time limit, of course, as doing otherwise would be entirely ridiculous.

Given the example reindeer from above, after the first second, Dancer is in the lead and gets one point. He stays in the lead until several seconds into Comet's second burst: after the 140th second, Comet pulls into the lead and gets his first point. Of course, since Dancer had been in the lead for the 139 seconds before that, he has accumulated 139 points by the 140th second.

After the 1000th second, Dancer has accumulated 689 points, while poor Comet, our old champion, only has 312. So, with the new scoring system, Dancer would win (if the race ended at 1000 seconds).

Again given the descriptions of each reindeer (in your puzzle input), after exactly 2503 seconds, how many points does the winning reindeer have?

--- Day 15: Science for Hungry People ---

Today, you set out on the task of perfecting your milk-dunking cookie recipe. All you have to do is find the right balance of ingredients.

Your recipe leaves room for exactly 100 teaspoons of ingredients. You make a list of the remaining ingredients you could use to finish the recipe (your puzzle input) and their properties per teaspoon:

capacity (how well it helps the cookie absorb milk)
durability (how well it keeps the cookie intact when full of milk)
flavor (how tasty it makes the cookie)
texture (how it improves the feel of the cookie)
calories (how many calories it adds to the cookie)
You can only measure ingredients in whole-teaspoon amounts accurately, and you have to be accurate so you can reproduce your results in the future. The total score of a cookie can be found by adding up each of the properties (negative totals become 0) and then multiplying together everything except calories.

For instance, suppose you have these two ingredients:

Butterscotch: capacity -1, durability -2, flavor 6, texture 3, calories 8
Cinnamon: capacity 2, durability 3, flavor -2, texture -1, calories 3
Then, choosing to use 44 teaspoons of butterscotch and 56 teaspoons of cinnamon (because the amounts of each ingredient must add up to 100) would result in a cookie with the following properties:

A capacity of 44*-1 + 56*2 = 68
A durability of 44*-2 + 56*3 = 80
A flavor of 44*6 + 56*-2 = 152
A texture of 44*3 + 56*-1 = 76
Multiplying these together (68 * 80 * 152 * 76, ignoring calories for now) results in a total score of 62842880, which happens to be the best score possible given these ingredients. If any properties had produced a negative total, it would have instead become zero, causing the whole score to multiply to zero.

Given the ingredients in your kitchen and their properties, what is the total score of the highest-scoring cookie you can make?

Your cookie recipe becomes wildly popular! Someone asks if you can make another recipe that has exactly 500 calories per cookie (so they can use it as a meal replacement). Keep the rest of your award-winning process the same (100 teaspoons, same ingredients, same scoring system).

For example, given the ingredients above, if you had instead selected 40 teaspoons of butterscotch and 60 teaspoons of cinnamon (which still adds to 100), the total calorie count would be 40*8 + 60*3 = 500. The total score would go down, though: only 57600000, the best you can do in such trying circumstances.

 --- Day 16: Aunt Sue ---

Your Aunt Sue has given you a wonderful gift, and you'd like to send her a thank you card. However, there's a small problem: she signed it "From, Aunt Sue".

You have 500 Aunts named "Sue".

So, to avoid sending the card to the wrong person, you need to figure out which Aunt Sue (which you conveniently number 1 to 500, for sanity) gave you the gift. You open the present and, as luck would have it, good ol' Aunt Sue got you a My First Crime Scene Analysis Machine! Just what you wanted. Or needed, as the case may be.

The My First Crime Scene Analysis Machine (MFCSAM for short) can detect a few specific compounds in a given sample, as well as how many distinct kinds of those compounds there are. According to the instructions, these are what the MFCSAM can detect:

children, by human DNA age analysis.
cats. It doesn't differentiate individual breeds.
Several seemingly random breeds of dog: samoyeds, pomeranians, akitas, and vizslas.
goldfish. No other kinds of fish.
trees, all in one group.
cars, presumably by exhaust or gasoline or something.
perfumes, which is handy, since many of your Aunts Sue wear a few kinds.
In fact, many of your Aunts Sue have many of these. You put the wrapping from the gift into the MFCSAM. It beeps inquisitively at you a few times and then prints out a message on ticker tape:

children: 3
cats: 7
samoyeds: 2
pomeranians: 3
akitas: 0
vizslas: 0
goldfish: 5
trees: 3
cars: 2
perfumes: 1

As you're about to send the thank you note, something in the MFCSAM's instructions catches
your eye. Apparently, it has an outdated retroencabulator, and so the output from the machine
isn't exact values - some of them indicate ranges.

In particular, the cats and trees readings indicates that there are greater than that many 
(due to the unpredictable nuclear decay of cat dander and tree pollen), while the pomeranians
and goldfish readings indicate that there are fewer than that many (due to the modial
interaction of magnetoreluctance).

--- Day 18: Like a GIF For Your Yard ---

After the million lights incident, the fire code has gotten stricter: now, at most ten thousand lights are allowed. You arrange them in a 100x100 grid.

Never one to let you down, Santa again mails you instructions on the ideal lighting configuration. With so few lights, he says, you'll have to resort to animation.

Start by setting your lights to the included initial configuration (your puzzle input). A # means "on", and a . means "off".

Then, animate your grid in steps, where each step decides the next configuration based on the current one. Each light's next state (either on or off) depends on its current state and the current states of the eight lights adjacent to it (including diagonals). Lights on the edge of the grid might have fewer than eight neighbors; the missing ones always count as "off".

For example, in a simplified 6x6 grid, the light marked A has the neighbors numbered 1 through 8, and the light marked B, which is on an edge, only has the neighbors marked 1 through 5:

1B5...
234...
......
..123.
..8A4.
..765.
The state a light should have next is based on its current state (on or off) plus the number of neighbors that are on:

A light which is on stays on when 2 or 3 neighbors are on, and turns off otherwise.
A light which is off turns on if exactly 3 neighbors are on, and stays off otherwise.
All of the lights update simultaneously; they all consider the same current state before moving to the next.

Here's a few steps from an example configuration of another 6x6 grid:

Initial state:
.#.#.#
...##.
#....#
..#...
#.#..#
####..

After 1 step:
..##..
..##.#
...##.
......

After 2 steps:
..###.

......
...#..
..##..
......
......

After 4 steps:
......
......
..##..
..##..
......
......
After 4 steps, this example has four lights on.

In your grid of 100x100 lights, given your initial configuration, how many lights are on after 100 steps?

--- Day 19: Medicine for Rudolph ---

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is sick! His nose isn't shining very brightly, and he needs medicine.

Red-Nosed Reindeer biology isn't similar to regular reindeer biology; Rudolph is going to need custom-made medicine. Unfortunately, Red-Nosed Reindeer chemistry isn't similar to regular reindeer chemistry, either.

The North Pole is equipped with a Red-Nosed Reindeer nuclear fusion/fission plant, capable of constructing any Red-Nosed Reindeer molecule you need. It works by starting with some input molecule and then doing a series of replacements, one per step, until it has the right molecule.

However, the machine has to be calibrated before it can be used. Calibration involves determining the number of molecules that can be generated in one step from a given starting point.

For example, imagine a simpler machine that supports only the following replacements:

H => HO
H => OH
O => HH
Given the replacements above and starting with HOH, the following molecules could be generated:

HOOH (via H => HO on the first H).
HOHO (via H => HO on the second H).
OHOH (via H => OH on the first H).
HOOH (via H => OH on the second H).
HHHH (via O => HH).
So, in the example above, there are 4 distinct molecules
 (not five, because HOOH appears twice) after one replacement from HOH.
 Santa's favorite molecule, HOHOHO, can become 7 distinct molecules 
 (over nine replacements: six from H, and three from O).

The machine replaces without regard for the surrounding characters. 
For example, given the string H2O, the transition H => OO would result in OO2O.

Your puzzle input describes all of the possible replacements and, at the bottom,
 the medicine molecule for which you need to calibrate the machine. 
 How many distinct molecules can be created after all the different ways 
 you can do one replacement on the medicine molecule?


That's not the right answer; your answer is too high. If you're stuck, 
there are some general tips on the about page, or you can ask for hints on the subreddit.
 Please wait one minute before trying again. (You guessed 552.) [Return to Day 19]

That's the right answer! You are one gold star closer to powering the weather machine. [Return to Day 19]



--- Part Two ---

Now that the machine is calibrated, you're ready to begin molecule fabrication.

Molecule fabrication always begins with just a single electron, e,
 and applying replacements one at a time, just like the ones during calibration.

For example, suppose you have the following replacements:

e => H
e => O
H => HO
H => OH
O => HH
If you'd like to make HOH, you start with e, and then make the following replacements:

e => O to get O
O => HH to get HH
H => OH (on the second H) to get HOH
So, you could make HOH after 3 steps. Santa's favorite molecule, HOHOHO, can be made in 6 steps.

How long will it take to make the medicine? Given the available replacements 
and the medicine molecule in your puzzle input, 
what is the fewest number of steps to go from e to the medicine molecule?

--- Day 20: Infinite Elves and Infinite Houses ---

To keep the Elves busy, Santa has them deliver some presents by hand, door-to-door.
 He sends them down a street with infinite houses numbered sequentially: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on.

Each Elf is assigned a number, too, and delivers presents to houses based on that number:

The first Elf (number 1) delivers presents to every house: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ....
The second Elf (number 2) delivers presents to every second house: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ....
Elf number 3 delivers presents to every third house: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, ....
There are infinitely many Elves, numbered starting with 1. 
Each Elf delivers presents equal to ten times his or her number at each house.

So, the first nine houses on the street end up like this:

House 1 got 10 presents.
House 2 got 30 presents.
House 3 got 40 presents.
House 4 got 70 presents.
House 5 got 60 presents.
House 6 got 120 presents.
House 7 got 80 presents.
House 8 got 150 presents.
House 9 got 130 presents.
The first house gets 10 presents: it is visited only by Elf 1, which delivers 1 * 10 = 10 presents. 
The fourth house gets 70 presents, because it is visited by Elves 1, 2, and 4, for a total of 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 presents.

What is the lowest house number of the house to get at least as many presents as the number in your puzzle input?

Your puzzle input is 29 000 000.

 Day 21: RPG Simulator 20XX ---

Little Henry Case got a new video game for Christmas. It's an RPG, and he's stuck on a boss. He needs to know what equipment to buy at the shop. He hands you the controller.

In this game, the player (you) and the enemy (the boss) take turns attacking. The player always goes first. 
Each attack reduces the opponent's hit points by at least 1. The first character at or below 0 hit points loses.

Damage dealt by an attacker each turn is equal to the attacker's damage score minus the defender's armor score. 
An attacker always does at least 1 damage. So, if the attacker has a damage score of 8, 
and the defender has an armor score of 3, the defender loses 5 hit points. 
If the defender had an armor score of 300, the defender would still lose 1 hit point.

Your damage score and armor score both start at zero. They can be increased by buying items in exchange for gold. 
You start with no items and have as much gold as you need.
 Your total damage or armor is equal to the sum of those stats from all of your items. You have 100 hit points.

Here is what the item shop is selling:

Weapons:    Cost  Damage  Armor
Dagger        8     4       0
Shortsword   10     5       0
Warhammer    25     6       0
Longsword    40     7       0
Greataxe     74     8       0

Armor:      Cost  Damage  Armor
Leather      13     0       1
Chainmail    31     0       2
Splintmail   53     0       3
Bandedmail   75     0       4
Platemail   102     0       5

Rings:      Cost  Damage  Armor
Damage +1    25     1       0
Damage +2    50     2       0
Damage +3   100     3       0
Defense +1   20     0       1
Defense +2   40     0       2
Defense +3   80     0       3
You must buy exactly one weapon; no dual-wielding. Armor is optional, but you can't use more than one. 
You can buy 0-2 rings (at most one for each hand). You must use any items you buy. 
The shop only has one of each item, so you can't buy, for example, two rings of Damage +3.

For example, suppose you have 8 hit points, 5 damage, and 5 armor, and that the boss has 12 hit points, 7 damage, and 2 armor:

The player deals 5-2 = 3 damage; the boss goes down to 9 hit points.
The boss deals 7-5 = 2 damage; the player goes down to 6 hit points.
The player deals 5-2 = 3 damage; the boss goes down to 6 hit points.
The boss deals 7-5 = 2 damage; the player goes down to 4 hit points.
The player deals 5-2 = 3 damage; the boss goes down to 3 hit points.
The boss deals 7-5 = 2 damage; the player goes down to 2 hit points.
The player deals 5-2 = 3 damage; the boss goes down to 0 hit points.
In this scenario, the player wins! (Barely.)

You have 100 hit points. The boss's actual stats are in your puzzle input. 
What is the least amount of gold you can spend and still win the fight?

To begin, get your puzzle input.

--- Day 22: Wizard Simulator 20XX ---

Little Henry Case decides that defeating bosses with swords and stuff is boring. 
Now he's playing the game with a wizard. Of course, 
he gets stuck on another boss and needs your help again.

In this version, combat still proceeds with the player and the boss taking alternating turns. 
The player still goes first. 
Now, however, you don't get any equipment; instead, you must choose one of your spells to cast.
 The first character at or below 0 hit points loses.

Since you're a wizard, you don't get to wear armor, and you can't attack normally.
 However, since you do magic damage, your opponent's armor is ignored, and so the boss effectively has zero armor as well. 
 As before, if armor (from a spell, in this case) would reduce damage below 1, it becomes 1 instead - that is, the boss' attacks always deal at least 1 damage.

On each of your turns, you must select one of your spells to cast. 
If you cannot afford to cast any spell, you lose. 
Spells cost mana; you start with 500 mana, but have no maximum limit. 
You must have enough mana to cast a spell, and its cost is immediately deducted when you cast it. 
Your spells are Magic Missile, Drain, Shield, Poison, and Recharge.

Magic Missile costs 53 mana. It instantly does 4 damage.
Drain costs 73 mana. It instantly does 2 damage and heals you for 2 hit points.
Shield costs 113 mana. It starts an effect that lasts for 6 turns. While it is active, your armor is increased by 7.
Poison costs 173 mana. It starts an effect that lasts for 6 turns. At the start of each turn while it is active, it deals the boss 3 damage.
Recharge costs 229 mana. It starts an effect that lasts for 5 turns. At the start of each turn while it is active, it gives you 101 new mana.


Effects all work the same way. Effects apply at the start of both the player's turns and the boss' turns. 
Effects are created with a timer (the number of turns they last); 
at the start of each turn, after they apply any effect they have, their timer is decreased by one. If this decreases the timer to zero, the effect ends. 
You cannot cast a spell that would start an effect which is already active. 
However, effects can be started on the same turn they end.

For example, suppose the player has 10 hit points and 250 mana, and that the boss has 13 hit points and 8 damage:

-- Player turn --
- Player has 10 hit points, 0 armor, 250 mana
- Boss has 13 hit points
Player casts Poison.

-- Boss turn --
- Player has 10 hit points, 0 armor, 77 mana
- Boss has 13 hit points
Poison deals 3 damage; its timer is now 5.
Boss attacks for 8 damage.

-- Player turn --
- Player has 2 hit points, 0 armor, 77 mana
- Boss has 10 hit points
Poison deals 3 damage; its timer is now 4.
Player casts Magic Missile, dealing 4 damage.

-- Boss turn --
- Player has 2 hit points, 0 armor, 24 mana
- Boss has 3 hit points
Poison deals 3 damage. This kills the boss, and the player wins.

Now, suppose the same initial conditions, except that the boss has 14 hit points instead:

-- Player turn --
- Player has 10 hit points, 0 armor, 250 mana
- Boss has 14 hit points
Player casts Recharge.

-- Boss turn --
- Player has 10 hit points, 0 armor, 21 mana
- Boss has 14 hit points
Recharge provides 101 mana; its timer is now 4.
Boss attacks for 8 damage!

-- Player turn --
- Player has 2 hit points, 0 armor, 122 mana
- Boss has 14 hit points
Recharge provides 101 mana; its timer is now 3.
Player casts Shield, increasing armor by 7.

-- Boss turn --
- Player has 2 hit points, 7 armor, 110 mana
- Boss has 14 hit points
Shield's timer is now 5.
Recharge provides 101 mana; its timer is now 2.
Boss attacks for 8 - 7 = 1 damage!

-- Player turn --
- Player has 1 hit point, 7 armor, 211 mana
- Boss has 14 hit points
Shield's timer is now 4.
Recharge provides 101 mana; its timer is now 1.
Player casts Drain, dealing 2 damage, and healing 2 hit points.

-- Boss turn --
- Player has 3 hit points, 7 armor, 239 mana
- Boss has 12 hit points
Shield's timer is now 3.
Recharge provides 101 mana; its timer is now 0.
Recharge wears off.
Boss attacks for 8 - 7 = 1 damage!

-- Player turn --
- Player has 2 hit points, 7 armor, 340 mana
- Boss has 12 hit points
Shield's timer is now 2.
Player casts Poison.

-- Boss turn --
- Player has 2 hit points, 7 armor, 167 mana
- Boss has 12 hit points
Shield's timer is now 1.
Poison deals 3 damage; its timer is now 5.
Boss attacks for 8 - 7 = 1 damage!

-- Player turn --
- Player has 1 hit point, 7 armor, 167 mana
- Boss has 9 hit points
Shield's timer is now 0.
Shield wears off, decreasing armor by 7.
Poison deals 3 damage; its timer is now 4.
Player casts Magic Missile, dealing 4 damage.

-- Boss turn --
- Player has 1 hit point, 0 armor, 114 mana
- Boss has 2 hit points
Poison deals 3 damage. This kills the boss, and the player wins.

 --- Day 23: Opening the Turing Lock ---

Little Jane Marie just got her very first computer for Christmas from some unknown benefactor. It comes with instructions and an example program, but the computer itself seems to be malfunctioning. She's curious what the program does, and would like you to help her run it.

The manual explains that the computer supports two registers and six instructions (truly, it goes on to remind the reader, a state-of-the-art technology). The registers are named a and b, can hold any non-negative integer, and begin with a value of 0. The instructions are as follows:

hlf r sets register r to half its current value, then continues with the next instruction.
tpl r sets register r to triple its current value, then continues with the next instruction.
inc r increments register r, adding 1 to it, then continues with the next instruction.
jmp offset is a jump; it continues with the instruction offset away relative to itself.
jie r, offset is like jmp, but only jumps if register r is even ("jump if even").
jio r, offset is like jmp, but only jumps if register r is 1 ("jump if one", not odd).
All three jump instructions work with an offset relative to that instruction. The offset is always written with a prefix + or - to indicate the direction of the jump (forward or backward, respectively). For example, jmp +1 would simply continue with the next instruction, while jmp +0 would continuously jump back to itself forever.

The program exits when it tries to run an instruction beyond the ones defined.

For example, this program sets a to 2, because the jio instruction causes it to skip the tpl instruction:

inc a
jio a, +2
tpl a
inc a
What is the value in register b when the program in your puzzle input is finished executing?
